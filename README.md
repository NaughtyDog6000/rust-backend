# rust-mmo-backend

this is my first project in rust which will be to make a backend for an mmo
it will include: **Accounts**, Player **inventories**, a central **exchange** with buy and sell offers, player-to-player **trading**

## Things I need to do

**Testing** - [] automated testing  
**Routes** - [] different routes for different things  
**DB** - [x] connection to read/write to and from  
**DB** - [] Atomic so there is no chance of a crash or error causing unexpected behavior
