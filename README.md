# rust-backend

this is my first project in rust which will be to make a backend for compsci project 
it will include: **Accounts**, Player **Achievements** (if I get round to it), **Leaderboards**, Potentially a way to **verify/simulate a game** when its uploaded to make sure that score values were not modified, **Friends** (am working on aquireing one of these to be able to test this concept), finally if I can be fucked it would store telemetry data to be able to make informed changes (what the most/least used things are, average game length, most difficult sections etc)

## Things I need to do

**Testing** - [] automated testing  
**Routes** - [] different routes for different things  
**DB** - [x] connection to read/write to and from  
**DB** - [] Atomic so there is no chance of a crash or error causing unexpected behavior
